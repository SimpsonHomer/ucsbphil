																  <p>I work mainly on philosophy of language, philosophy of mind  (including philosophy of psychology), and philosophy of logic. My current  research concerns three topics: the nature of assertion; non-propositional  varieties of representation; and the relation between computational and mental  processes. Comments on all papers (especially unpublished drafts) are welcome.</p>

<p>Many philosophers worry that the computational theory of mind engenders epiphenomenalism. Building on Block's (1990) discussion, I formulate a particularly troubling version of this worry. I then develop a novel solution to CTM's epiphenomenalist conundrum. I develop my solution within an interventionist theory of causal relevance, as espoused by Woodward (2003) and others. My solution radically departs from orthodox versions of CTM. In particular, I reject the widespread picture of digital computation as formal syntactic manipulation. </p></li>

																	    <p>Under what conditions does a physical system implement or realize a computation? Structuralism about computational implementation, espoused by Chalmers and others, holds that a physical system realizes a computation just in the case the system instantiates a pattern of causal organization isomorphic to the computation's formal structure. I argue against structuralism through counter-examples drawn from computer science. On my opposing view, computational implementation sometimes requires instantiating semantic properties that outstrip any relevant pattern of causal organization.</p>

																	  <li>“<a href="cvs/papers/formal.pdf">Are Computational Transitions Sensitive to Semantics?</a>”, forthcoming in <em>Australasian Journal of Philosophy</em>
																	    <p>The formal conception of computation (FCC) holds that computational processes are not sensitive to semantic properties. FCC is popular, but it faces well-known difficulties. Accordingly, authors such as Block and Peacocke pursue a &quot;semantically-laden&quot; alternative, according to which computation can be sensitive to semantics. I argue that computation is insensitive to semantics within a wide range of computational systems, including any system with &quot;derived&quot; rather than &quot;original&quot; intentionality. FCC yields the correct verdict for these systems. I conclude that there is only one promising strategy for semantically-laden theorists: identify special computational systems that help generate their own semantic properties, and then show that computation within those systems is semantically-laden. </p>

																        <br />
																      Church’s thesis asserts that a  number-theoretic function is intuitively computable if and only if it is  recursive. A related thesis asserts that Turing’s work yields a <em>conceptual  analysis</em> of the intuitive notion of numerical computability. I endorse  Church’s thesis, but I argue against the related thesis. I argue that purported  conceptual analyses based upon Turing’s work involve a subtle but persistent  circularity.<br />

														              <p>Alston, Searle, Williamson, and  many others advocate <em>the restrictive  model of assertion</em>, according to which certain constitutive assertoric  norms <em>restrict </em>which propositions one  may assert. Sellars and Brandom advocate <em>the  dialectical model of assertion</em>, which treats assertion as constituted by  its role in the game of giving and asking for reasons. Sellars and Brandom  develop a restrictive version of the dialectical model. I explore a <em>non-restrictive </em>version of the  dialectical model. On such a view, constitutive assertoric norms constrain how  one must react if an interlocutor challenges one’s assertion, but they do <em>not </em>constrain what one should assert in  the first place.</p>

														            <li>“<a href="cvs/papers/linguistic2.pdf">A Linguistic Reason for Truthfulness</a>”, in <em>Truth and Speech Acts</em>, ed. Dirk Greimann  and Geo Siegwart
														              <p>This paper further develops the  non-restrictive dialectical perspective. Many philosophers hold that  truthfulness is somehow constitutive of assertion. I argue against this view while  simultaneously attempting to ground truthfulness in assertion’s essential  features. I argue that truthfulness is the <em>prima  facie</em> best way to avoid decisive counter-arguments against what one says.  Moreover, avoiding decisive counter-arguments is a constitutive goal of rational  dialectic. Thus, while truthfulness is not constitutive of assertion, it is the  rational default strategy for achieving a goal that is constitutive of  assertion.</p>

															            <p><em>Dialectical  foundationalists</em>, including Adler, Brandom, Leite, and Williams, claim that  some asserted propositions do not require defense just because an interlocutor  challenges them. By asserting such a proposition, the speaker shifts the burden  of proof to her interlocutor. <em>Dialectical  egalitarians</em> claim that all asserted propositions require defense when  challenged. I elucidate the dispute between dialectical foundationalists and  egalitarians, and I defend a broadly egalitarian stance against several  prominent objections.</p>

									                                    <p>Dialectical egalitarianism apparently  generates a vicious “regress of justifications,” since an interlocutor can  challenge the premises through which a speaker defends her original assertion,  and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. I argue that  the putative regress is not worrisome and that egalitarianism can handle it  quite satisfactorily. I also defend a positive view that combines an  anti-foundationalist conception of dialectical interaction with a  foundationalist conception of epistemic justification.</p>

															            <p>I argue that maps do not feature  predication, as analyzed by Frege and Tarski. I take as my foil Casati and  Varzi’<em>s Parts and Places</em>, which  attributes predication to maps. I adduce intuitions about cartographic  truth-conditions that militate against this attribution. I conclude that  attaching a marker to map coordinates is a different mode of semantic  composition than attaching a predicate to a singular term.</p>

															          <li>“<a href="cvs/papers/mapsfinal.pdf">Cognitive Maps and the Language of Thought</a>”, <span style="font-style: italic">British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</span>
															            <p>Fodor advocates a view of cognitive processes as computations defined over the language of thought (or Mentalese). Even among those who endorse Mentalese, considerable controversy surrounds its representational format. What semantically relevant structure should scientific psychology attribute to Mentalese symbols? Researchers commonly emphasize logical structure, akin to that displayed by predicate calculus sentences. To counteract this tendency, I discuss computational models of navigation drawn from probabilistic robotics. These models involve computations defined over cognitive maps, which have geometric rather than logical structure. They thereby demonstrate the possibility of rational cognitive processes in an exclusively non-logical representational medium. Furthermore, they offer much promise for the empirical study of animal navigation.</p>

															            University Press<br />
																        <br />
																        I critique an ancient argument for the possibility of non-linguistic deductive inference. The argument, attributed to Chrysippus, describes a dog whose behavior supposedly reflects disjunctive syllogistic reasoning. Drawing on contemporary robotics, I urge that we can equally well explain the dog's behavior by citing probabilistic reasoning over cognitive maps. I then critique various experimentally-based arguments from scientific psychology that echo Chrysippus's anecdotal presentation.

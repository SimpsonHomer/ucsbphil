																  <p>I'm an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_But_Dissertation" target="_blank">ABD</a> grad student, working toward a PhD (to be finished by Spring 2011). I received my M.A. and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_of_Philosophy" target="_blank">C.Phil.</a> in philosophy here at <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu">UCSB</a> in 2008 and my B.A. in philosophy from <a href="http://www.csus.edu/phil/" target="_blank">CSU Sacramento</a> in 2005. In Fall 2009, I was a visiting student at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/%7Ephilos/www/">MIT</a> in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.</p>
																  <p>Most of my <a href="http://www.joshdmay.com/research/">research</a> is in moral psychology, meta-ethics, action theory, and epistemology---especially as they relate to moral (or, more broadly, normative) thought, feeling, and motivation. These are the topics I take up in my most recent work, including <a href="http://www.joshdmay.com/research/pubs/">articles</a> which will be appearing in <a href="http://www.springer.com/philosophy/journal/11098"><em>Philosophical Studies</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0966-8373"><em>European Journal of Philosophy</em></a>, and the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%292041-6962/homepage/custom_copy.htm">Spindel Supplement</a> of the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%292041-6962"><em>Southern Journal of Philosophy</em></a>. I currently serve as Assistant to the General Editors at the <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/" target="_blank"><em>Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em></a> and a Leaf Editor for <a href="http://philpapers.org/">PhilPapers</a>. Recently, I was awarded the Spindel <a href="http://www.joshdmay.com/philosophy/emerging-scholar-prize/">Emerging Scholar Prize</a> as well as an <a href="http://www.apaonline.org/divisions/pacific/pacific.aspx">Outstanding Graduate Student Paper Prize</a> from the American Philosophical Association.</p>
																  <p>For the 2010-2011 academic year, I’ll be on the job market, finalizing my <a href="http://www.joshdmay.com/research/dissertation/">dissertation</a>, and teaching (some at <a href="http://academic.cuesta.edu/socsci/Phil.htm">Cuesta College</a>, some at UCSB). This summer I will participate in a <a _mce_href="http://www.knowinginreligionandmorality.com/seminar.html" href="http://www.knowinginreligionandmorality.com/seminar.html">Summer Seminar at Purdue</a> on Perceptual, Moral, and Religious Skepticism.</p>

However, there has been some   recent debate about whether this captures the ordinary notion of   weakness of will. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/philos/www/holton.html">Richard Holton</a> (1999, 2009) claims that it doesn’t, while <a href="http://www.fsu.edu/%7Ephilo/people/faculty/almele.html">Alfred    Mele</a> (2010) argues that, to a certain   extent, it does. As Mele recognizes, the question about an ordinary   concept here is one apt for empirical investigation. Our plan is to   evaluate Mele’s studies and report some experiments of our own in order   to investigate what in the world the ordinary concept of weakness of   will is. We conclude that neither Mele nor Holton (previously) was quite   right and offer a tentative proposal of our own: the ordinary notion is   more like a prototype or cluster concept whose application is affected by a variety of factors.<br />

                                                                  <p><span style="font-style: italic">Abstract</span>: Some   philosophers  and psychologists have evaluated psychological egoism   against recent  experimental work in social psychology.  Dan Batson   (1991; forthcoming),  in particular, argues that empathy tends to induce   genuinely altruistic  motives in humans. However, some argue that there   are egoistic  explanations of the data that remain unscathed.  I focus   here on some  recent criticisms based on the idea of self-other merging   or &quot;oneness,&quot;  primarily leveled by Robert Cialdini and his   collaborators.  These  authors argue that the putatively altruistic   subjects are acting on  ultimately egoistic motives because empathic   feelings for someone in  distress tend to cause the helper to blur the   distinction between  oneself and the other.  Employing a conceptual   framework for the debate I  have previously developed, I argue that the   self-other merging  explanation fails to explain the empathy-helping   relationship on  conceptual grounds, regardless of the results Cialdini   et al. (1997)  report.</p>

C. Daniel Batson and other  social psychologists have argued that experiments provide support for a  theory called the &quot;empathy-altruism hypothesis&quot; that entails the  falsity of psychological egoism. However, several critics claim that  there are egoistic explanations of the data that are still not ruled  out. One of the most potent criticisms of Batson comes from Elliott  Sober and David Sloan Wilson. I argue for two main theses in this  paper: (1) we can improve on Sober and Wilson’s conception of  psychological egoism and altruism, and (2) this improvement shows that  one of the strongest of Sober and Wilson's purportedly egoistic  explanations is not tenable. A defense of these two theses goes some  way toward defending Batson‘s claim that the evidence from social  psychology provides sufficient reason to reject psychological egoism.<br />

The cases we  focus on are two that are crucial to Stanley’s project:  one in which  the protagonist does <em>not</em> have practical interest in the truth of the proposition she claims to know (<em>Low  Stakes</em>) and one in which the protagonist <em>does</em> have such practical  interest (<em>High Stakes</em>).   We experimentally test the empirical claims that Stanley seems to make  concerning our common-sense intuitions about these cases.   Additionally, we test the empirical claims that Jonathan Schaffer seems to make, regarding the salience of an alternative, in his critique of Stanley (&quot;The Irrelevance of the Subject,&quot;  2006). Our data indicate that neither raising the possibility of error  nor raising stakes moves people from attributing knowledge to denying  it.  However, the raising of stakes (but not alternatives) does affect  the level of <em>confidence </em>people have in their attributions of  knowledge.  We argue that our data cast doubt on what both Stanley and  Schaffer claim our common-sense judgments about such cases are.<br />

But so-called &quot;Humean&quot; theories—holding that all motivation has its source in desire—insist on connecting such beliefs with an antecedent motive. Rationalists, on the other hand, allow normative beliefs a more independent role. I argue in favor of the rationalist view by defending against some recent challenges (from Lenman, Mele, and Sinhababu) and by appealing to the kinds of considerations of &quot;moral fetishism&quot; that some (e.g. Smith) have leveled against motivational externalism. But first we must realize that Smith’s argument against externalists is a poor one, because it saddles them with the Humean view, which they needn’t hold, and misconstrues the central problem. However, a proper construal reveals that, contrary to the orthodox dialectic, Humeans rather than rationalists are stuck attributing to virtuous agents the infamous &quot;motive of duty.&quot; While this argument may be subject to some powerful objections, consideration of it reveals a way to tip the scales in favor of motivational rationalism.<br />

Rationalists claim  that at least sometimes beliefs about what one has reason to do can be the  ultimate source of one’s motivation. So-called “Humeans,” on the other hand, maintain  that motivation always ultimately has its source in desire. Such theses are partly  empirical in nature. As such, I investigate how some empirical work, from neuroscience  to social psychology, bears on this debate. The focus is limited to neurological  disorders (such as “acquired sociopathy”) and temptation (“delayed  gratification”). Perhaps surprisingly, I argue that the evidence is entirely  compatible with a rationalistic view of motivation and in some cases provides some  tentative support for it. While this does not address certain sentimentalist views  that eschew the “Humean” or instrumentalist conception of motivation, a  decidedly rationalist thesis remains in play.<br />

<p><span style="font-style: italic">Abstract: </span>Walter   Sinnott-Armstrong (2006) has recently argued for moral skepticism—the   view that no one has any moral knowledge. Unlike most moral skeptics,   however, he models one of his central arguments on the kind of skeptical   hypotheses we find among skeptics about the external world. I show  that we can reject this argument once we realize that Sinnott-Armstrong’s  formulation of it fails to incorporate some important details regarding  skeptical hypothesis arguments in general. In particular, unlike external world skeptics, he does not   provide the crucial skeptical scenario required to substantiate such   arguments.</p>

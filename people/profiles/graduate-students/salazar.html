<h2 id="research-abstract">Research Abstract</h2>
<p>In my dissertation, I examine Christine Korsgaard’s neo-Kantian constructivist theory of moral obligation, which attempts to develop a genuine alternative to the traditional theories of the origin and nature of ethics, which are subjectivism and realism. Korsgaard argues that previous constructivist accounts have been unsuccessful in explaining morality because they cannot escape their subjective origin. Her arguments and theory are ambitious and have been noted by most commentators as being extremely nebulous. However, such a constructivist account, if possible, would be a very attractive alternative to subjectivism and realism, in which we must seemingly choose between claiming that morality is an illusion or believing in mysterious non-empirical moral ‘facts.’ In Part 1, I attempt to understand various arguments that may be made for Korsgaard’s view and in Part 2, I examine two general versions of a Korsgaardian-inspired constructivist account for theoretical consistency and plausibility. I am very sympathetic to her approach and view, but I think that arguments for the view fail on grounds of validity and that the two general versions of the theory are either inconsistent or implausible. In investigating the arguments and theoretical possibilities for a Korsgaardian-inspired constructivist view, I hope to eliminate and illuminate some criterion and strategies that those of us searching for an alternative to the traditional theories can use for developing a more integrated view of ethics.</p>
<p>Korsgaard claims that the previous constructivist attempts fail because they assume that it is possible to create shared, public reasons through an exchange between people of subjective, private reasons. Korsgaard argues that public reasons can never be generated from private ones, and on these grounds she states that morality necessitates that our created moral reasons are already essentially public. She argues that reasons must be public in order to admit the sharing of reasons, and thus the existence of morality by comparing reasons to language. She utilizes Wittgenstein’s private language argument for the purposes of showing that private reasons, like private languages, are impossible. She says that “it takes two to make a reason,” so all reasons are already public and shared. Furthermore, the imperative force of a reason can be given to others in any act of communication since reasons create normative standards for anyone who understands them. In Part 1, I argue that her argument is invalid for three reasons: (1) it relies on a dubious analogy to Wittgenstein’s private language argument; (2) it assumes that people are obligated to hear others’ reasons and then uses this to ground the publicity of morality, which begs the question; and (3) it establishes only that reasons are understandable when communicated, not that understanding alone creates universal or public reasons.</p>
<p>Although I think that the arguments that can be constructed from her writings fail, her theory deserves consideration in itself as a possible alternative account and in Part 2, I explore two general ways of seeing her view which derive from two primary theses forming the basis of her account: the Constructivism Thesis (regarding the source of reasons) and the Publicity Thesis (regarding the nature of reasons). I argue that on one construal of the publicity of reasons, inconsistencies within the theory itself force us to dismiss either the Constructivism Thesis or the Publicity Thesis. However, on the alternative construal of the publicity of reasons, an extremely undesirable result follows, which has the effect of showing that the theory under this description is committed to accepting a radical form of ethical relativism that is ungrounded in and unlimited by rationality. This result is particularly meaningful since it eliminates Korsgaard’s constructive publicity as being a ‘third way’ theory and instead makes it a version of subjectivism, which is an undesirable result even from Korsgaard’s perspective. Since these two ways of construing the publicity condition encompass all of the alternatives, and both are unsatisfactory, I argue that Korsgaard’s account of constructive publicity ought to be rejected. If my arguments succeed, I will have shown that it is not merely this or that particular argument and variations of it within Korsgaard’s work that are mistaken, but that the general account as a whole does not work together properly to express itself as a consistent, satisfying, and genuine alternative to the traditional theories of ethics. All of these arguments indicate that a weaker form of constructivism, which admits some non-publicly constructed reasons, offers more a attractive alternative to those in search of a consistent and plausible alternative in ethics.</p>

<h2 id="research-abstract">Research Abstract</h2>
<p>I received my B.A. and M.A. degrees in philosophy from UCSC, spending the second year of my masters program at Berkeley under the UC intercampus exchange program. My thesis was largely a defense of a posteriori physicalism from the well known attacks of Putnam and Nagel.</p>
<p>My main interests lie within the overlap between philosophy of language and logic, with the liar paradox being something of a splinter in my mind as of late. More generally, I am interested in the limits of linguistic expression, which I see as restricted by logical space, which is in turn restricted by ontology. That is, roughly and crudely, I don’t think it is possible to say anything that is literally true (or false) about “things” that don’t exist. In my time here at UCSB I have become increasingly interested in epistemology, largely influenced by the classes I’ve taken with Tony Brueckner and Michael Rescorla. In particular I would like to consider closure more closely.</p>
<p>I started grad school purely due to my love of philosophy, just hoping that I would find teaching tolerable. While working on my M.A. I found that I enjoy teaching even more, mainly for the “Ah-ha!” moments (when something clicks). I liked to TA/teach Logic more than any other class since there are always at least a few struggling yet determined students to work closely with who ultimately they do very well. I enjoyed teaching so much that in the two years before starting PhD program here, I was an instructor at an elementary school in Berkeley (2nd, then followed my class to 3rd grade), and found that even more rewarding. I can almost see myself finishing up my PhD and going back to teach elementary school anyway, but I do so enjoy philosophy as well.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>I am a philosophy robot. Well, okay, I suppose I have other interests. I enjoy the usual things (movies, music, and books), and also like to paint, ride my bike, or just wander around aimlessly while absorbing the scenery. I have also gotten back into video games recently, playing way too much Left 4 Dead 2 as of this writing.</p>

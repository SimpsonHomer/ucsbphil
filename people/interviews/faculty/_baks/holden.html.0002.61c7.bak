											<b>How long have you been part of the UCSB faculty? And where were you before UCSB?</b><br />
											This is my second year here. Previously I taught at Syracuse University, and before that I was in the doctoral program at UNC-Chapel Hill. Originally I’m from Yorkshire, England.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What is your area of specialization?</b><br />
												Seventeenth and eighteenth century philosophy<br />
											<br />
											<b>What do you consider to be the most pressing philosophical issues of our day?</b><br />
											It is an ancient (and possibly perennial) issue, but questions in the epistemology of metaphysics – where and how we can have metaphysical knowledge – seem as pressing as ever.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What do you like to do when you're not doing philosophy?</b><br />
												I read lots of history and am very absorbed by politics and current affairs. Like most Brits, I love a good-natured political argument, preferably over a pint. I listen to a lot of music, especially 1960s rock and soul oldies (what a vital era!).<br />
											<br />
											<b>How does the UCSB philosophy department compare, in terms of its faculty, graduate program and general philosophical aptitude, with other departments that you've been a part of?</b><br />
												Splendidly. We have excellent coverage of the core areas of analytic philosophy, but good breadth across history, ethics, and political philosophy too.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Are there any areas of philosophy that you feel our department is particularly strong in? How about weaknesses (if any)?</b><br />
											Our clearest strength is our depth in the core areas of analytic philosophy – language, mind, epistemology and metaphysics. We could really do with a Kant scholar, both for the historical coverage and since Kant remains such an influential figure today.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Are you working on any special projects at the moment?</b><br />
											I’ve been working mainly on Hume’s various criticisms of religious systems of ethics. I’ve also been looking at the seventeenth century debates over the authority and limits of reason in figures like Boyle, Bayle and Locke.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Do you have any &quot;words of wisdom&quot; for individuals who may be considering a career in professional philosophy?</b><br />
												Get as wide an exposure to the various areas of philosophy as possible. Philosophers must be generalists, but students can sometimes fix exclusively on a relatively narrow specialization too early. Attending as many philosophy colloquia as you can is a must!<br />

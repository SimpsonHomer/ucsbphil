											<b>What made you decide to be a (professional) philosopher?</b><br />
											There are two reasons. First, I was originally set on going into psychology as a career.  However, the psych classes I took in college taught me that psychologists oftentimes make (what I thought were) assumptions that they ought not assume and draw conclusions from their data that they have no right to draw.  It was irritating, so it seemed like philosophy was a better fit for me.  The second reason can be summarized by a quote from the movie OFFICE SPACE: &quot;Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.&quot;  Ain't that the truth? <br />
											<br />
											<b>What do you consider to be the most pressing philosophical issues of our day?</b><br />
											With the advances of philosophy of language in the 20th century, and contributions from psychology and cognitive science, I think philosophy of mind is in a position to gain some serious ground in the coming decades.  Also, considering the global climate of today, a good theory of distributive justice is quite pressing.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What are some of your favorite philosophical problems (issues, etc.)?</b><br />
											We've come so far since Descartes, yet skeptical problems are still looming.  It is arguably THE central issue in philosophy.  If there's a good solution out there, it'd be nice to hear.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Where are you in terms of the program (what phase)?</b><br />
												I plan to submit my qualifying paper sometime this year.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What's your area of specialization?</b><br />
											My qualifying paper deals with nonconceptual perceptual content.  I am attempting to block the epistemological argument whose conclusion is that perceptual content is conceptual.  So, I suppose I am specializing in philosophy of mind and epistemology.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Are there any areas of philosophy that you feel our department is particularly strong in? How about weaknesses (if any)?</b><br />
											There are many strengths, but I suppose particular strengths lie in philosophy of language, epistemology, and mind.  With the passing of the incomparable Hubert Schwyzer, the department is currently without a Kant scholar, and I suppose that is a weakness.<br />
											<br />
											<b>It seems that our department is a very close department, both in and out of the office... What advantages do you think this brings to an academic department?</b><br />
											Going to &quot;work&quot; each day is fun.  How many people can say that?  That we are a close department is one of the reasons why being here kicks ass so much.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What do you like to do when you're not doing philosophy?</b><br />
											I used to drink, but now I'm married.  Most weekends, my wife and I take our dogs to the dog beach.  I like hiking, tennis, and basketball (by the way, we need some tall players for the team this year), and I'm still waiting for an incoming student who wants to golf.  Any takers?<br />
											<br />
											<b>Where do you see yourself in five years (ideally)?</b><br />
											I heard some rumors that Jeb Bush was considering running for president.  If there is another Bush in the white house in five years, you can find me in Canada.  There's nothing ideal about; it's just true.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Do you have any &quot;words of wisdom&quot; for individuals who may be considering a career in professional philosophy?</b><br />
											Do it.  Watch OFFICE SPACE.<br />

											<b>What made you decide to be a (professional) philosopher?</b><br />
											When I was a tender and impressionable undergraduate I spent a year as an exchange student in Amsterdam. At the time I was an art history major, but there was this course offered there by a young and eager post-doc, called “Skepticism.” I had no clue what I was doing, no experience in philosophy whatsoever, but did not let that hold me back from arguing passionately with the seminar of (all male and cocky) experienced philosophy students. As a term paper I chose the topic “Wittgenstein and Davidson on Rule Following.” The damage was thus done and I never looked back. I decided to pursue a life as professional philosopher when I discovered how very smart and very interesting my professors were. Simple: I wanted to continue playing with these guys. Then my teaching of undergrads proved to be much more fun that I ever expected, so it keeps being fun. Also, when you have studied and practiced philosophy for a while it becomes very hard to relate to The Normal World, so I think if I leave Academia for a normal job I will drive everyone crazy.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What do you consider to be the most pressing philosophical issues of our day?</b><br />
											You mean within the research community, or for the purpose of making the world a better place? I am not so optimistic about the latter but a part of me refuses to give up. I would really like to be a philosopher who could make the general public reflect more and act less on the basis of ideology or strongly felt emotional convictions. This is not very original, but I think the most “pressing” philosophy issue has not changed since good old Socrates.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What are some of your favorite philosophical problems (issues, etc.)?</b><br />
											I am eternally fascinated with concept formation, mental representation, perception – and as a implication of this, the question of how we can know truths about the world. I think that this is the topic I have approached from different angles since that Wittgenstein/Davidson paper. I am an (obstinate) skeptic at heart, but I like to know the enemy, i.e., I am very interested in Platonic Ideas and Stoic self-evidently true impressions.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Where are you in terms of the program (what phase)?</b><br />
												I'm in the dissertation phase.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What's your area of specialization?</b><br />
												Stoic philosophy of mind. They are nuts, those Stoics, but I really enjoy their company.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Are there any areas of philosophy that you feel our department is particularly strong in? How about weaknesses (if any)?</b><br />
											Well, my own supervisor is a formidable one-woman band in Ancient Philosophy, so despite us being low in number on Ancient philosophers, this woman is an intellectual powerhouse. From my experience with the areas of metaphysics, language and mind in the department I will say that we have an excellent learning environment for a student whose interests are in these areas. The professors who specialize in this are many, very competent, very approachable and they represent fruitfully different perspectives on the problems in this area. If you as a student are interested in Continental Philosophy, that is, anything Nietzsche, Heidegger, Hegel, Sartre or aesthetics – don’t come here. There ain’t nothing of that going on. Not even dearest Ludwig W. has been given any time lately.<br />
											<br />
											<b>It seems that our department is a very close department, both in and out of the office... What advantages do you think this brings to an academic department?</b><br />
												I think this place is excellent. Truly. I personally consider the small size of the department a great advantage. From a social perspective: We all arrive here as first-years without knowing anyone but because there are so few of us graduate students, we all will meet in some seminar or other and bump into each other all the time, so we become fast friends. At least that was my experience. From an intellectual perspective: As we all see each other all the time, both professors and students, the opportunities for intellectual interaction are legion (unavoidable) and the small community also keeps a check on bad behavior. You do not want to aggravate a professor, the staff or another student because there are so few of us and we all have to get along. There is no drama here, no petty faction-making, no rigid hierarchy, and best of all, a complete lack of pretentiousness. I experience the department to have a very constructive atmosphere, with very approachable professors and staff.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What do you like to do when you're not doing philosophy?</b><br />
												I go to the gym, run or ride my bike to shut my brain off. Santa Barbara county is stunningly beautiful, and running along the Pacific Ocean under a Technicolor sky is still ridiculously exotic for me. Riding in this area is like riding in Tuscany (with bigger cars). Santa Barbara itself is not particularly happening, so I scamper off to S.F. or L.A. as often as I can afford. There I point my camera at the local wild-life and mingle with the deviants.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Where do you see yourself in five years (ideally)?</b><br />
												Best case scenario? In some ethnically diverse city, state or junior college close to a big, big city.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Do you have any &quot;words of wisdom&quot; for individuals who may be considering a career in professional philosophy?</b><br />
												Make sure you have taken some time between your undergraduate degree and graduate school. You will never finish or enjoy a Ph.D. if you are not *very* certain that you are able to and comfortable with spending a lot of time alone, poring over material that you will not understand and that will drive you crazy. Advanced philosophy studies are very consuming, and if you are lackadaisical about it you will impress no one. Be as structured and professional as you can from the very beginning.<br />

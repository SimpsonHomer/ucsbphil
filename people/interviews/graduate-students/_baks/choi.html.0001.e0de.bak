											<b>What made you decide to be a (professional) philosopher?</b><br />
											I studied and majored in philosophy as an undergraduate, mostly as a preparation for graduate work in theology. My plan was to get a doctorate in the subfield of theology known as &quot;systematic theology&quot; and to teach it at a seminary (or other appropriate graduate level institution). However, during seminary I happened to read some books on the philosophy of religion written by &quot;analytic philosophers,&quot; people like: Alvin Plantinga, Thomas Morris, Richard Swinburne, and George Mavrodes. In particular, Plantinga's GOD, FREEDOM, AND EVIL made a significant impact on my thinking. I liked the way it approached traditional problems in theology (e.g. the problem of evil, the existence of God) with rigor and precision. Somewhat ironically, I found that such philosophers did a better job in illuminating theological issues, and with far greater clarity, than contemporary theologians themselves, men like: Wolfhart Pannenberg, Rudolf Bultmann, Karl Rahner, and Paul Tillich, to name a few. (But just don't take my word for it. Take the following &quot;taste test&quot;: read some writings from the aforementioned philosophers and then read (or try to read!) some writings from the theologians I mentioned, and then decide which group does a better job of illuminating theological issues.) It is through reading such philosophers of religion that I was naturally lead into other main subfields of analytic philosophy, e.g. metaphysics, philosophy of mind, epistemology. So my path to becoming a professional philosopher forms a nice arc: from philosophy to theology, and then back to philosophy. The prodigal son has come back home!<br />
											<br />
											<b>What do you consider to be the most pressing philosophical issues of our day?</b><br />
												That is a deep question--and I guess it is too deep for me, for I can't think of a good answer to it!<br />
											<br />
											<b>What are some of your favorite philosophical problems (issues, etc.)?</b><br />
												Currently, I'm preoccupied with the metaphysics of free will--what free will is and how it is possible. Closely related to this, I also have an interest in how the notion of free will is related to the notion of moral responsibility. Besides those problems, I have an abiding interest in the following issues: Cartesian-style skepticism about the external world (and different attempts to refute it), the proper analyses of the various divine attributes (e.g. what is omnipotence, omniscience?), personal identity (e.g. what makes me the same person I was ten years ago?), material constitution (e.g the statue-clay puzzles), the nature of time (e.g. presentism vs. four-dimensionalism), and the relationship between divine providence and human freedom (e.g. molinism, open theism).<br />
											<br />
											<b>Where are you in terms of the program (what phase)?</b><br />
												I am at the dissertation phase, and I am busily trying to finish it.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What's your area of specialization?</b><br />
												Currently, it is metaphysics (in particular, the metaphysics of free will). I'm also trying to gain an expertise (so as to publish) in epistemology and philosophical theology.<br />
											<br />
											<b>Are there any areas of philosophy that you feel our department is particularly strong in? How about weaknesses (if any)?</b><br />
											In the traditional &quot;core&quot; areas (e.g. philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics), I think that UCSB is very strong. (And in my view, it deserves to be ranked higher on the Leiter Report, which most prospective graduate students use to determine which programs to apply to.) As for our weaknesses, I think that we can use another professor who specializes in the history of philosophy. More specifically, I think that we need another professor who can teach modern philosophy. Tom Holden does a good job teaching mostly the empiricists, e.g. Hume, Locke, Berkeley. I think we need someone who can do an equally good job teaching the rationalists (e.g. Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz) as well as Kant. (By the way, Voula Tsouna does a fantastic job teaching ancient philosophy (e.g. presocratics, Plato, Aristotle).<br />
											<br />
											<b>It seems that our department is a very close department, both in and out of the office... What advantages do you think this brings to an academic department?</b><br />
												For one, professors are (for the most part) readily accessible to graduate students. That is very important and should not be underestimated. Also, I'm impressed with the calibre of graduate students at UCSB. (By the way, I'm not counting myself, so this is not a subtle form of self promotion!) We have some very sharp, motivated, and contentious graduate students who can, and are more than willing to, serve as testing grounds for incohate philosophical ideas one might have.<br />
											<br />
											<b>What do you like to do when you're not doing philosophy?</b><br />
												I like to watch movies and spend time with my wife (the two often coincide).<br />
											<br />
											<b>Where do you see yourself in five years (ideally)?</b><br />
												With a job teaching philosophy somewhere--and hopefully that job is a tenure-track one!<br />
											<br />
											<b>Do you have any &quot;words of wisdom&quot; for individuals who may be considering a career in professional philosophy?</b><br />
												If you can honestly imagine yourself being happy and without any regrets doing anything else besides philosophy, then DON'T BECOME A PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHER.<br />

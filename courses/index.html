<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>The primary goal of this course is to get you thinking about your thinking.  Our focus will be on constructing and evaluating arguments.  We will begin by distinguishing arguments from other uses of language.  Then we will look at two different kinds of arguments — inductive and deductive arguments — and how to discriminate between good and bad arguments.  Throughout the course we will consider several common errors in reasoning.  Finally, special attention will be paid to symbolizing arguments and providing proofs in a formal language. </p>

<p>In this course, we will explore the nature and authority of conscience. We begin with an overview of the various theories proposed by philosophers and psychologists, from the medieval period to today. Many claim that conscience is our moral guide, a source of moral knowledge. The show <em>Dexter</em> provides us with one such view, in which Dexter, a presumed psychopath, internalizes his father, who is his conscience, that directs him to do what is right. We will assess the reliability of such claims. We will also ask whether we should obey our conscience, and on what grounds, particularly in the face of violating the law. Finally, we will look at how we can develop and cultivate our consciences, and address those who lack conscience altogether, often thought to be the case with psychopaths.</p>

We will also look at his theory of the state of nature, the normative basis of law and political authority, his treatment of religion, and his case for an absolutist contractarian politics.</p>

<p>The computational theory of mind (CTM) holds that the mind is a computational system. CTM plays a large role in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind. We will examine CTM, discussing specific scientific models along with general philosophical considerations. We will examine how CTM bears upon such issues as the metaphysics of mind, mental causation, psychological explanation, and the problem of intentionality. We will be particularly concerned to understand the relation between syntax and semantics, as those notions figure in computational models of mental activity. Readings by Putnam, Fodor, Chalmers, Burge, Peacocke, Pylyshyn, Searle, and others.</p>

<p>This course will examine the philosophy of David Hume (1711-76), particularly his metaphysics, his epistemology, and his philosophy of mind as expressed in the Treatise of Human Nature. We will focus first and foremost on book 1 of the Treatise (‘Of the Understanding’). Although we will also consult the parallel sections of the Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding and the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion to challenge and/or confirm our interpretation of Hume’s system, the backbone of the course will be a close reading of Treatise book 1. So this will be a nuts and bolts course, examining the detailed mechanics of Hume’s theoretical philosophy in the Treatise.</p>

									      <p>
									        <center>
									        </center>
        The department  benefits greatly from annual unrestricted support and major gifts designated  for special purposes. Your generosity plays a critical role in our  ability to fulfill our mission and is truly appreciated. Every gift  counts. <br />
									          <br />
									        There are many ways to support the Department in their  educational and research endeavors. Listed below are our key  priorities: <br />
									        -Unrestricted Funds<br />
									        -Student Support<br />
									        -Faculty Support<br />
								          </p>
									      <p>We invite you to be a part of the Department's success in educating the next generation of leaders by making a gift to   the Department either on-line, via mail, or by phone.</p>
									      <p> <strong><u>Unrestricted Funds</u></strong><br />
									        Unrestricted gifts to the department are designated to the highest  priority needs. This flexible funding allows the department to seize  new opportunities that emerge as well as support the existing  outstanding students, faculty, programs and research. </p>
									      <p> <strong><u>Student Support</u></strong><br />
								          </p>
									      <p><em>Undergraduate Students</em><br />
									        Undergraduate  scholarship support allows the department to recognize and mentor  outstanding undergraduate students. Contributions at any level are  greatly appreciated and allow us to support undergraduate research. <br />
									        <br />
									        <u>Named Endowed Scholarships</u>:  A gift of $20,000 or more establishes a permanent named scholarship  which could support undergraduate research. For information on creating a named full named endowed scholarship, contact Kathy Jenquin at 805-893-3121 or<a href="mailto:jenquin@hfa.ucsb.edu"> jenquin@hfa.ucsb.edu</a>.<br />
                                            <br />
                                          </p>
									      <p><em>Graduate Students</em><br />
									        Support for graduate students  is a key priority for the department. We are able to attract more  strong out of state and international students to our program than we  can afford to support.<br />
									        <br />
									        <br />
                                            <u>Named Fellowship Award</u>:A gift of $5,000 or more establishes a one-year named award which allows the Department to offer supplemental   incentive (top-off) support for the recruitment or retention of an outstanding graduate student. <br />
                                            <br />

This type  of fellowship is extremely helpful for graduate students as it allows  them to take a quarter off from teaching and focus solely on writing  the dissertation. <br />
                                            <br />

                                            <strong><u>Endowed Chairs</u></strong><br />
									        Endowed Chairs honor, encourage, and support the professors whose  brilliant minds and commitment to education and research promote the  University's mission. An endowed chair is the most significant honor  the University can offer to faculty, by way of a donor's generosity.  Holders of endowed chairs represent the most distinguished scholars who  are selected for brilliant scholarship, inspirational teaching, and  leadership. An endowed chair is a permanent endowment created by a  philanthropic gift that supports the teaching and research of the  scholar. A gift of $500,000 or more will support the creation of a new  endowed chair and will provide a legacy for the donor on the UC Santa  Barbara campus.<br />
									        For information on creating a named endowed chair contact Kathy Jenquin at 805-893-3121 or <a href="mailto:jenquin@hfa.ucsb.edu"> jenquin@hfa.ucsb.edu</a>. </p>
